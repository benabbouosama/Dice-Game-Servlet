  <li>A die cannot be rolled more than once during a game; repeated rolls result in a score of -1.</li>
  <li>If the result of die 1 is strictly less than the result of die 2, and the result of die 2 is strictly less than the result of die 3, the player's score is the sum of the three results.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the player's score is zero.</li>
  <li>The game ends either after rolling all three dice, due to a repeated roll of the same die, or if the condition "result (die 1) < result (die 2) < result (die 3)" is not met.</li>
  <li>At the end of a game, the player's score and the highest recorded score are displayed.</li>
